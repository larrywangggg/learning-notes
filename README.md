# Learning Repository

This repository is used to **track and practise my ongoing technical learning**.  
Each topic represents an area I am actively working on or plan to complete through hands-on coding and notes.

Topics move from **In Progress → Done** as learning milestones are completed.

## 🟡 In Progress
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- AWS
- Docker
- Redis
- Cache

- Next.js + TypeScript
- CI/CD
- Git
---

## 📂 Structure

Each topic is organised in its own folder and may include:
- runnable code
- experiments
- notes
- incremental commits reflecting learning progress

This repository is **learning-focused**, not production-ready.
